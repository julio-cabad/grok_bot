# Trading Bot Enhancements - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for enhancing the existing trading bot with critical risk management, backtesting capabilities, and advanced trading features. The current bot successfully generates trading signals using Squeeze Momentum and Magic Trend indicators, but requires professional-grade risk management and validation systems to maximize profitability and minimize risk.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Dynamic Risk Management System

**User Story:** As a trader, I want dynamic risk management that adapts to market conditions, so that I can protect my capital more effectively than fixed stop losses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN market volatility increases THEN the system SHALL adjust stop loss distances proportionally
2. WHEN a position moves in profit THEN the system SHALL implement trailing stop functionality
3. WHEN position size is calculated THEN the system SHALL use dynamic position sizing based on volatility
4. WHEN maximum drawdown threshold is reached THEN the system SHALL halt trading temporarily
5. IF a position reaches breakeven THEN the system SHALL move stop loss to breakeven automatically
6. WHEN ATR changes significantly THEN the system SHALL recalculate all risk parameters

### Requirement 2: Comprehensive Backtesting System

**User Story:** As a trader, I want to backtest my strategies on historical data, so that I can validate performance and optimize parameters before risking real capital.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN backtesting is initiated THEN the system SHALL process historical data for specified date ranges
2. WHEN backtest completes THEN the system SHALL generate performance metrics including win rate, profit factor, and Sharpe ratio
3. WHEN analyzing results THEN the system SHALL calculate maximum drawdown and recovery periods
4. WHEN comparing strategies THEN the system SHALL provide side-by-side performance comparisons
5. IF parameter optimization is requested THEN the system SHALL test multiple parameter combinations
6. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL create visual charts and detailed trade logs

### Requirement 3: Circuit Breaker Protection

**User Story:** As a trader, I want automatic circuit breakers during extreme market conditions, so that I can avoid catastrophic losses during market crashes or flash crashes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN market volatility exceeds predefined thresholds THEN the system SHALL pause all new trades
2. WHEN rapid price movements occur THEN the system SHALL implement emergency position closure
3. WHEN multiple consecutive losses occur THEN the system SHALL reduce position sizes automatically
4. WHEN daily loss limits are reached THEN the system SHALL halt trading for the remainder of the day
5. IF system errors occur repeatedly THEN the system SHALL enter safe mode with notifications
6. WHEN market conditions normalize THEN the system SHALL resume normal operations automatically

### Requirement 4: Multi-Timeframe Confirmation

**User Story:** As a trader, I want signals confirmed across multiple timeframes, so that I can increase the probability of successful trades.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing 1H signals THEN the system SHALL check 4H trend alignment
2. WHEN 4H trend conflicts with 1H signal THEN the system SHALL either reject or reduce position size
3. WHEN daily trend supports the signal THEN the system SHALL increase confidence score
4. WHEN multiple timeframes align THEN the system SHALL allow maximum position size
5. IF timeframe analysis is inconclusive THEN the system SHALL wait for better confluence
6. WHEN trend changes on higher timeframes THEN the system SHALL adjust existing positions

### Requirement 5: Enhanced Volume Analysis

**User Story:** As a trader, I want sophisticated volume analysis integrated into signal generation, so that I can identify higher probability trades with institutional backing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN volume spikes occur THEN the system SHALL analyze if they support the price direction
2. WHEN volume is declining THEN the system SHALL reduce signal strength accordingly
3. WHEN analyzing breakouts THEN the system SHALL require volume confirmation
4. WHEN institutional volume patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL increase position confidence
5. IF volume divergence occurs THEN the system SHALL issue warnings or exit signals
6. WHEN comparing current volume to historical averages THEN the system SHALL adjust signal quality scores

## Technical Constraints

### Performance Requirements
- Backtesting system must process 1 year of 1H data in under 5 minutes
- Risk management calculations must complete within 100ms
- Circuit breaker responses must trigger within 1 second of threshold breach

### Data Requirements
- Historical data storage for minimum 2 years across all symbols
- Real-time data processing with maximum 5-second latency
- Backup and recovery systems for critical trading data

### Integration Requirements
- Must integrate seamlessly with existing Squeeze Momentum and Magic Trend strategies
- Must maintain compatibility with current Telegram notification system
- Must support existing Binance API integration without disruption

### Security Requirements
- All risk parameters must be configurable through secure configuration files
- Circuit breaker thresholds must be protected from accidental modification
- Backtesting results must be stored securely with audit trails

## Success Criteria

### Quantitative Metrics
- Increase win rate from current 65-70% to target 70-75%
- Improve risk/reward ratio from 1:2 to 1:2.5
- Reduce maximum drawdown to below 10%
- Achieve consistent monthly returns of 15-25%

### Qualitative Metrics
- Reduced emotional stress through automated risk management
- Increased confidence in trading decisions through backtesting validation
- Better sleep quality knowing circuit breakers protect against extreme losses
- Professional-grade trading system suitable for scaling capital

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- Continued access to Binance API for historical and real-time data
- Stable internet connection for real-time risk management
- Sufficient computational resources for backtesting operations

### Internal Dependencies
- Current trading bot infrastructure must remain operational during enhancements
- Existing configuration system must be extended to support new parameters
- Current logging and monitoring systems must be enhanced for new features

## Assumptions

- Market conditions will remain within historical volatility ranges
- Binance API will continue to provide reliable data feeds
- Current technical indicators (Squeeze Momentum, Magic Trend) will remain effective
- User will maintain disciplined approach to risk management settings

## Out of Scope

- Machine learning or AI-based signal generation (current technical analysis is effective)
- High-frequency trading or sub-minute timeframes
- Multiple exchange integration (focus remains on Binance)
- Social trading or copy trading features
- Mobile application development (focus on core trading engine)
